# Project Title
## Area-Calculator
This project is an area-calculator, which can calculate the area of squares, rectangles, triangles and circles. It can support the input of centimeter and inch units, and the results of the calculation can be automatically converted into the square centimeter.

# Getting Started
Before you start using Area-Calculator, you have to make it available on your computer. Just click on the ZIP file and you can download the area calculator.

# Running the tests
Before using the project, you can try to enter simple graphical data and compare the results with the correct results. If the output is correct, the project test is successful.

# Usage
![The initial page of the Area-calculator](面积计算器初始页面.png)
First, select the calculated area object on the initial page.

Then you are prompted to enter the underlying data for the calculated object you want.

Finally, the area calculator can automatically determine the area of the object.
